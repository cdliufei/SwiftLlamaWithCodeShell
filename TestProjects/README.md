#  Test project for SwiftLlama package

There are three targets in this demostration: 
one iOS app target, one MacOS app target and one command line app, 
which are located in different folder group. Also, there is a Shared folder group 
that contains code/resources that are shared.

Please note there's no models are included in this repo.
If you want to run these apps, 
you need to download your own models and modify the code to use them accordingly.
In cased of the command line app, you just need to give the right path to the app 
in scheme settings or in terminal app when you run it in terminal.
